      "details": "A portrait can also refer to the orientation of a photograph and is the opposite of a landscape photograph. While most portraits of people are done in portrait orientation it is not unheard of to see portraits created in the landscape.Although the definition of portrait photography sounds simple enough, this form of photography can be complicated to master. Portrait photography can be commercial or fine art which has very different goals. When it comes to fine art photography, the primary goal of portrait photography is to capture beautiful images that appear natural and allow a subject’s personality to shine through.Portrait photographs are also required for countless commercial purposes, such as passports, professional biographies, security passes, and other documentation."

      "details": "In theater, film, and television, actors, models, singers, and other entertainers are often required to include a head shot, along with their résumé, when applying for a job. Those head shots are intended for helping them land a career, an actor headshot should help casting directors understand the person exactly as he or she is (i.e., age group & ethnic background), while the actor hopes that the headshot will inspire the casting director to hire him or her.[1] Head shots often feature the actor or actress facing off-center. A performer will often have head shots expressing different poses and expressions to give a potential employer an idea of the subject's range of appearances or expressions. These types of head shots are called. It is common for an actor to have different head shots for different roles, but for the most part these consist of a change in attire. The head shots that include a person's shoulders are called three-quarter shots. Previously, head shots were often in black-and-white; however, most head shots are now taken in color"
